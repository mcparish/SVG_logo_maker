# SVG_logo_maker

## Description

This purpose of this application is to build a Node.js command-line application that will take in the user input and then generate and SVG logo.  In this project I learned how to generate an SVG file by creating prompts for the user to enter including the color of the text, the shape of the logo, and the color of the logo itself.  

## Installation

In order to use this application you will first need to open the integrated terminal and then starting the application by running the node index.js command. 

## Usage

After the application is started you will be prompted to enter three letters, then the color of the text, then the shape of the logo, and finally the color of the logo itself. Once the final prompt is entered the logo will be created.
